# Airbnb Listings in New York City data analysis

I have used publicly avaiable data from Tableau data resource. I have conducted basic data cleaning in Python Pandas and done a dashboard in BI tool - Tableau. I have tried to ask for some questions.
- What is the spatial distribution of average renting price in NYC ?
- What are the most popular hosts and their rating ?
- What is the number of properties avaiable per type of property ?
- What is the percentage distribution for every type of rooms per neiberhoud or chosen combination ?
- What is general number of properties avaiable per neiberhoud and its average price ?
- Where is the most affrodable area for renting the apartment ?
- Showing general density of properties across NYC
