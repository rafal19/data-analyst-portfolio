# Premier League Players Web Scrapper (Data scrapped from Fbref)

I have wrritten the code that generates the data set of the user's choice. The user can choose between 8 sections of data type and 20 teams in any combination. The output is a CSV file containing the stats of the players selected by the user. The user has to enter values in the exact way as listed above the list of options in each part of program.
